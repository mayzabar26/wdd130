    <h2>Mayza Costa Barbosa</h2>
    <h3> 
Hey there! My name is Mayza Costa Barbosa and I reside in São Luís, a lovely island in the northeast of Brazil.
I live with my parents and my 11-year-old brother. I'm a huge fan of movies, technology, board games, and sports, among
other things!
One interesting fact about me is that I adore music, particularly Queen and ABBA.
Whenever I'm not listening to music, you can find me with my face in a book.
Currently, I'm reading "A Flicker in the Dark" by Stacy Willingham.
I'm a newbie to programming, but I'm thrilled to acquire new skills and make new acquaintances in this course.</h3>
