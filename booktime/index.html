            <p>
                Stephen King, born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine, is a prolific American author known for his contributions to the horror 
                and supernatural fiction genres. Raised by a single mother after his father's departure, King developed a passion for storytelling from an early age. 
                He attended the University of Maine and, while working odd jobs, struggled with financial hardships.
