            <p>
                Stephen King, born on September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine, is a prolific American author known for his contributions to the horror 
                and supernatural fiction genres. Raised by a single mother after his father's departure, King developed a passion for storytelling from an early age. 
                He attended the University of Maine and, while working odd jobs, struggled with financial hardships.

                His personal life has been marked by battles with addiction, and in 1999, he survived a near-fatal car accident.
