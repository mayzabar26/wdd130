            <p class="review1">
                Carrie is my favorite Stephen King book! It was his first work, and his writing has improved a lot since he launched Carrie in 1974.
                However, this book is the reason why I love his stories and also why I love horror stories. We all know that books are better than 
                the movies, and I had this confirmation when I read Carrie a few years ago. In the movies we just have a stories about a 
                shy girl whom was bullied at school, and out of the blue, she discovered superpowers. Sounds familiar like some movies we 
                have out there, right? The book is so much more than that! It's about how powerful she really is that the whole town could feel and hear her, 
                it's about the abusive relationship that her mother had, and it's the reason why she is the way that she is, it's about the 
                vilians the their stories. It's about so much more! Now, let me tell you a little bit about the story. Without spoilers, of course!

            <h1 class="passage">Cujo</h1>
            <p>
                "And the dog seemed to know. His terrible, thoughtless eyes never left Donna
                Trenton's wide blue ones. He paced forward slowly, almost languidly. Now he was
                standing on the barnboards at the mouth of the garage. Now he was on the crushed
                gravel twenty-five feet away. He never stopped growling. It was a low, purring
                sound, soothing in its menace. Foam dropped from Cujo's snout. And she couldn't
                move, not at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Then Tad saw the dog, recognized the blood which streaked its fur, and shrieked
                â€”a high piercing sound that made Cujo shift his eyes. And that was what seemed to
                free her."
