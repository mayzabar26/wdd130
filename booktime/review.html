            <p class="review1">
                Carrie is my favorite Stephen King book! It was his first work, and his writing has improved a lot since he launched Carrie in 1974.
                However, this book is the reason why I love his stories and also why I love horror stories. We all know that books are better than 
                the movies, and I had this confirmation when I read Carrie a few years ago. In the movies we just have a stories about a 
                shy girl whom was bullied at school, and out of the blue, she discovered superpowers. Sounds familiar like some movies we 
                have out there, right? The book is so much more than that! It's about how powerful she really is that the whole town could feel and hear her, 
                it's about the abusive relationship that her mother had, and it's the reason why she is the way that she is, it's about the 
                vilians the their stories. It's about so much more! Now, let me tell you a little bit about the story. Without spoilers, of course!

            <p>
                Stephen King's 'Carrie' introduces readers to a compelling protagonist, Carrie White, a high school student with telekinetic abilities. 
                Carrie's character is a complex blend of vulnerability and resilience, making her instantly relatable to readers (Carrie White from the 
                book is so much better than the movies!). The intricate dynamics of her relationship with her fanatically religious mother add a layer 
                of psychological depth to the narrative, as Carrie struggles with both the oppressive control and unconditional love from her mother.

            <p>
                The discovery of Carrie's telekinetic powers serves as the main point in the story, marking a shift from the mundane struggles 
                of high school life to a supernatural exploration of her newfound abilities. King masterfully weaves elements of horror into the narrative, 
                creating a gripping tale of a girl coming to terms with her extraordinary powers. The novel's antagonists, particularly the bullies at school, 
                contribute to the escalating tension, making both sympathy for Carrie and a sense of dread as events unfold. 'Carrie' stands as a testament 
                to King's ability to blend the supernatural with the everyday, creating a memorable and haunting exploration of power, identity, and the consequences 
                of cruelty.
