        <h1 class="river1">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h1>

        <p class="content1">
            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, 
            the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. 
            High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
            This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, 
            interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
        </p>

        <p class="content2">
            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
        </p>

        <p class="content3">
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  
            This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

        <h1 class="river2">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h1>
        <p>
          This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all
          river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with
          breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river
          experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating
          whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
          accessible only by river.
        </p>
        <p>
          CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The
          rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to
          accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
          However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
          rating scale, so we often refer to both.
